Note I intended this add on to work as an expansion for the Official Core and Enemy in Shadows WHFRP Modules by Moo Man.
So it references some of those icons.


LAW’S PET SHOPPE

This module is based on the blog posts by Andy Law on WFRP

It is an expansion of the henchmen rules to handle pets.

In summary according to the rules:
• Pets are 'Henchmen'.
• Henchmen have full Character Sheets and are given to a Player to play alongside their PC.
• A Player's Henchmen earn half the XP of their PC.
• This XP is spent as normal.

This Expansion fills in the gap to allow pets to be created
It breaks down dogs, horses and cats (only one cat) into main ‘breeds’ by their roles and gives statistics for each.

Then breaks them down further into ‘pure breeds’ also with statistic.

Adds random traits tables for dog, horses and cats
/table cat-traits
/table dog-traits
/table horse-traits

Adds two new talents: Fated (to account for a cats many lives and perhaps wizards), Trick Riding for riders.

Adds new Traits: Amble, Surefooted, Swimmer, Fine (reapproprated from qualities to account for breeding), and Ugly (a flaw reused as a trait).
Updated Trained Trait. Broken was never supposed to imply the Bestial trait was ignored completely.
Plus adds some ‘Extra Training’ skills.

Adds are price lists for each type and breed and a table for how to price your own.

Adds a new generic henchman career for dogs, horses and cats. A sort of adventure's pet career for each type. I’ve made journals for each of the careers.

Finally a journal covering the main rules for using pets as Henchman (including some mentioned above).


NOTE: If you are wondering. Pets start with no basic skills and don’t have a status or earning skills as per the blog posts. But skills including basic ones can be developed within the pet careers.


One day perhaps a henchman generator like the character generator will enable better intergration of this module but I lack the coding skills unfortunately.
Finally any suggestions or improvements to module I would love to hear.

A final big thanks to Andy Law and MooMan without which this would not exist

thanks

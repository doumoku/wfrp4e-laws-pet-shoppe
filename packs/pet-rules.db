We have a base statline for Dogs on page 315 and Wolves on page 317. We also have the rules for Henchmen on page 309.<br /><br />Why are the Henchmen rules so important? Because they are specifically designed for, amongst other things, handling pets. Let's take a look at what they say?<br /><br />In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pets are 'Henchmen'.</li>\n<li>Henchmen have full Character Sheets and are given to a Player to play alongside their PC.</li>\n<li>A Player's Henchmen earn half the XP of their PC.</li>\n<li>This XP is spent as normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds great. But, can you see the missing element here?</p>\n<p>Yup, the Careers in Chapter 3 aren't exactly designed for dogs, or, indeed, any pets, so spending XP could prove a touch difficult.</p>\n<p>So, I'm going to fix that.</p>\n<p>However, before I do, there are more dog stats for us to look at. I added statlines for two breeds of dogs in&nbsp;Enemy in Shadows. These are the Telland Pit Bull on page 98, and the Ulzhammer Shepherd Dog on page 111. I also statted a 'Fighting Dog' to the&nbsp;<em>Guide to Ubersreik</em>, page 53, and there is the Dog used for pulling carts in the&nbsp;<em>Enemy in Shadows Companion</em>&nbsp;on page 22. No need to look 'em up if you don't have the books to hand; it's just good to note they exist for the moment, so you know everything I create below takes these into account.<br /><br />So, looking at those, we have a Dog, a Draught Dog, a Wolf, a Pit Bull, Shepherd Dog, and a Fighting Dog all nicely statted and ready for careers. However, we don't have a single Small but Vicious Dog.<br /><br />Call in the PCs, because this is a Warhammer crime that needs to be investigated!</p>\n<p>It's time to do some doggo statting.</p>\n<p>But, me being me, I'm not just going to do our Small But Vicious, I'm going to loosely cover all dogs. Coz it's my blog and I can.<br /><br />To do that, I'm going to stat 8 different loose domesticated dog types that'll cover all the basics I'll need. The ones I'll go for are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Herd Dogs</li>\n<li>Hound Dogs</li>\n<li>Hunting Dogs</li>\n<li>Lap Dogs</li>\n<li>Mongrel Dogs</li>\n<li>Pit Dogs</li>\n<li>Terrier Dogs</li>\n<li>War Dogs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br />#AllTheDogs<br /><br />Well, almost, I'm missing out some work doggos&nbsp;&ndash; you know, ones that pull sleds or the like, the aforementioned 'draught' dog from the&nbsp;<em>Enemy in Shadows Companion</em>&nbsp;&ndash; but I'll add these later.

Stop the press. That's over a third of the Careers needing horsies. We need full rules for these, and stats! After all, we wouldn't want to leave our horsie friends without attributes, would we!</p>\n<p>So, what do we need to resolve, horse-wise? Well, let's take a look through the Careers and see what riding animals are mentioned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Destrier</li>\n<li>Draught Horse</li>\n<li>Light Warhorse</li>\n<li>Horse (we can assume this means any horse you prefer)</li>\n<li>Mule</li>\n<li>Pony</li>\n<li>Riding Horse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As expected, really, given these are all the horsies mentioned in the Consumer Guide in&nbsp;WFRP on page 306. It's almost like I planned it that way...</p>\n<p>But are all these equids properly statted in the rulebook?</p>\n<p>There are stats for the following riding animals (assuming we discount 'monsters' like Pegasi or Demigryphs and so on) in&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong>'s bestiary in Chapter 12:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[wfrp4e-core.bestiary.b1R5sW6lYIViJ2ki]{Horse}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Are there any other rules to reference?<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />Thankfully, yes. There is much more horsey goodness to be found on pages 22&ndash;24 in the&nbsp;<strong>Enemy in Shadows Companion</strong>; we also get stats for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Draught Horse</li>\n<li>Heavy Warhorse (Destrier)</li>\n<li>Light Warhorse (Hobby)</li>\n<li>Pony/Donkey/Mule</li>\n<li>Riding Horse (Palfrey)</li>\n<li>Heavy Draught Horse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's much better. But I also have two primary issues.<br /><br />1) Ponies, Donkies, and Mules are all given the same stats, but are quite different animals in real life.<br />2) Ponies also cost double the price of Mules and Donkeys, but have the same stats.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lawhammer.blogspot.com/2020/03/my-kingdom-for-horse.html\">WHRP: Horses</a></p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>CATS</h3>\n<p><strong>WFRP4</strong>&nbsp;needs a Cat.

{"name":"Costing New Breeds","permission":{"default":0,"49AXXoPz63AAzPKB":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hkL8aNdVrP32n0Mq"}},"content":"<p>For each 'Advance' (i.e.: each +5 to an Attribute or +1 to Move), the cost to buy the breed increases by 1/&ndash;. Further, for each Creature Trait a new breed has, or step increase with the <em>Size</em> Trait (e.g.: from Small to Medium), the costs increase by another 10/&ndash;. Lastly, for each Decrease (which I'll count as each &ndash;5 in an Attribute or &ndash;1 Move), the cost for the breed decreases by 1/&ndash;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Change</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each Advance</td>\n<td>+1/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each new Trait or Size increase</td>\n<td>+10/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Each Decrease</td>\n<td>&ndash;1/&ndash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, let's apply that to the Telland. It has 11 Advances, 1 Decrease, and 2 Traits when compared to the Pit Dog. That equates to +11/&ndash;, &ndash;1/&ndash;, +20/&ndash;. So, and extra +20/&ndash; on top of the base 2GC for a Pit Hound. So the Telland has a base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash;.<br /><br />Nice. What about the Ulzhammer?<br /><br />Well, it has 16 Advances, 3 Decreases, and 3 new Traits, so +16/&ndash;, &ndash;3/&ndash;, +30/&ndash;. Adding that to the base cost of 2 GC for a Herding Dog, we get base cost of 4GC 3/&ndash;.<br /><br />That... works well enough for me. I don't feel I need rules to create the different breeds (I'll simply make them up as needed later in this post), but some rules for costing them will be handy. And the ones above do nicely.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if I'm sorting prices for buying and selling doggos, I should also consider Item Qualities, especially if I'm considering creating special breeds like the Telland or Ulzhammer. After all, pure-bred animals always cost more, which sounds like the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to me.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />However, the normal Item Qualities rules don't really apply as Dogs are living creatures, so I'm going to limit it to just the one I need. So I'll just use the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent a pedigree.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />So, the more&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Qualities purchased, the stronger the bloodline of the animal, and the more impressive it appears. This brings no advantages beyond bragging rights and high returns if the animal is ever sold. So, if a Player wants to buy any special breed beyond the generic versions presented at the beginning of this post, at least 1 instance of&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;should have to be bought to show it's a purebred animal accessing the special rules. I'll not make that a firm rule, as I may wish to keep costs low at some points; it's more of a guideline that I'll almost always follow.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />That would mean a typical Telland actually starts at 7GC (the base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash; is doubled because of the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality). Obviously, Mongrels cannot purchase the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent breeding, but it could be purchased to show a dog with a particularly pretty face or similar.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />That'll do.<br /><br />Equally, I'll dump the Item Flaws outside&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>. Taking the&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>&nbsp;Flaw for your pet shows it's particularly ill-favoured in appearance, which may come with penalties in some situations.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />Normally, both&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;can't be applied to a single doggo, but I'm sure there are examples of ugly versions of purebred animals, so I'll not make that a hard rule, and leave it to individual circumstances to dictate.<br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" /><br style=\"caret-color: #333333; color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue Light', HelveticaNeue-Light, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: auto;\" />So, let's put all of that into action with a variety of new breeds for each of the Dog types, alongside their prices. I'll use the formula I quickly pulled from nowhere for most of the coin costs here, but a few breeds will break this as they are especially rare.</p>","_id":"kosbILKw9OX1ZOca"}

We have a base statline for Dogs on page 315 and Wolves on page 317. We also have the rules for Henchmen on page 309.<br /><br />Why are the Henchmen rules so important? Because they are specifically designed for, amongst other things, handling pets. Let's take a look at what they say?<br /><br />In summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pets are 'Henchmen'.</li>\n<li>Henchmen have full Character Sheets and are given to a Player to play alongside their PC.</li>\n<li>A Player's Henchmen earn half the XP of their PC.</li>\n<li>This XP is spent as normal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds great. But, can you see the missing element here?</p>\n<p>Yup, the Careers in Chapter 3 aren't exactly designed for dogs, or, indeed, any pets, so spending XP could prove a touch difficult.</p>\n<p>So, I'm going to fix that.</p>\n<p>However, before I do, there are more dog stats for us to look at. I added statlines for two breeds of dogs in&nbsp;Enemy in Shadows. These are the Telland Pit Bull on page 98, and the Ulzhammer Shepherd Dog on page 111. I also statted a 'Fighting Dog' to the&nbsp;<em>Guide to Ubersreik</em>, page 53, and there is the Dog used for pulling carts in the&nbsp;<em>Enemy in Shadows Companion</em>&nbsp;on page 22. No need to look 'em up if you don't have the books to hand; it's just good to note they exist for the moment, so you know everything I create below takes these into account.<br /><br />So, looking at those, we have a Dog, a Draught Dog, a Wolf, a Pit Bull, Shepherd Dog, and a Fighting Dog all nicely statted and ready for careers. However, we don't have a single Small but Vicious Dog.<br /><br />Call in the PCs, because this is a Warhammer crime that needs to be investigated!</p>\n<p>It's time to do some doggo statting.</p>\n<p>But, me being me, I'm not just going to do our Small But Vicious, I'm going to loosely cover all dogs.

Of note, look to Broken, which was never supposed to imply the&nbsp;<em>Bestial</em>&nbsp;trait was ignored completely.<br /><br /><strong>Broken:</strong> The animal has been domesticated. Now tame, it gains +2d10&nbsp;<strong>Fel</strong>, even if it has the&nbsp;<em>Bestial</em>&nbsp;trait. Further, it can now learn more&nbsp;<em>Trained</em>&nbsp;traits (see&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong>&nbsp;page 199).</p>\n<p><strong>Calm:</strong> The animal gains a bonus of +10 to Tests to ignore panic caused by the <em>Skittish</em> trait for each point it has in Calm. It can have a maximum of <strong>WPB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Drive:</strong> The animal is trained to pull a coach, cart, plough, buggy, or similar. The animal can pull up to its own body weight for <strong>TB</strong> hours without needing to make an Endurance Test. The animal can also pull up to twice its body weight for short hauls of <strong>TB</strong> minutes. The animal's gains a bonus of +1 <strong>TB</strong> to do this for each point it has in Drive. It can have a maximum of <strong>WPB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Fetch:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to spot and retrieve an object or prey undamaged.</p>\n<p><strong>Pack</strong>: The animal is trained to carry great weights on its back. It can carry its Strength rating in Encumbrance points upon its back for each point it has in Pack. This limit is doubled for each step in the Size trait to the creature has above Large. It can have a maximum of <strong>TB</strong> rating in this trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Pointer:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to spot birds and 'point' to them by freezing and aiming their muzzle towards the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical:</strong> The animal is trained to accept a spellcaster as a rider. Without this Trained trait, the animal typically shies from spellcasters.</p>\n<p><strong>War:</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to carry a rider into the hell of war. It can use its Rider&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong>WP</strong>&nbsp;instead of its own&nbsp;for all appropriate Tests</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NEW TRAITS</h2>\n<h3>Amble</h3>\n<p>The creature has a smooth gait, making it more comfortable to ride over long distances. Add +Amble hours to any length of time a rider can comfortably ride. Further, reduce the Combat Difficulty for<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><em>Shooting From Horseback</em><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>by 1 step.*</p>\n<p>*: Amble references rules I use where you can't ride a horse for longer than&nbsp;<strong>TB</strong>&nbsp;hours a day without picking up some&nbsp;<em>Fatigue</em>&nbsp;Conditions, depending upon the results of an&nbsp;<strong>Endurance</strong>&nbsp;Test. Further, Shooting From Horseback is a penalty of at least &ndash;20, depending upon the circumstances. Riders with the&nbsp;<em>Trick Riding&nbsp;</em>Talent reduce this difficulty by 1 step.</p>\n<h3>Fine</h3>\n<p>This repurposes the Item <em>Fine</em> Quality for animals. For animals the <em>Fine </em>Trait represents a pedigree. Mongrels cannot purchase the <em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality to represent breeding, but it could be purchased to show a dog with a particularly pretty face or similar.</p>\n<p>If a Player wants to buy any special breed beyond the generic versions, at least 1 instance of&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;should be bought to show it's a purebred animal accessing the special rules.</p>\n<p>For each&nbsp;<em>Fine</em> Trait the animal has, its price is doubled and its @JournalEntry[Going To Market]{Availability} is one step less.</p>\n<p>A typical Telland actually starts at 7GC (the base cost of 3GC 10/&ndash; is doubled because of the&nbsp;<em>Fine</em>&nbsp;Quality).</p>\n<p>The more&nbsp;<em>Fine</em> Traits purchased, the stronger the bloodline of the animal, and the more impressive it appears. This brings no advantages beyond bragging rights and high returns if the animal is ever sold.</p>\n<p>NOTE: Insisting special breeds have the Fine quality is not a firm rule, as you may wish to keep costs low at some points; it's more of a guideline that you should most always follow.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin: 0px; outline: none; padding: 0px;\">Sure-Feet</h3>\n<p>The creature can instinctually find its footing, even when it has a rider on its back. The creature automatically passes all Tests concerning uncertain footing caused by such things as screes, rocky trails, heavy undergrowth, and similar.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;None of the creatures in the&nbsp;<strong>WFRP</strong> rulebook should have either of these two traits, but they could be used as an Optional wherever you feel it fits.</p>\n<h3>Swimmer</h3>\n<p>Start with <em>Swim</em> Skill +10</p>\n<h3>Ugly</h3>\n<p>This repurposes the Item <em>Ugly</em> Flaw for animals. Taking the <em>Ugly</em> Trait for your pet shows it's particularly ill-favoured in appearance, which may come with penalties in some situations.</p>\n<p>Ugly animals attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suffer a &ndash;10 penalty.</p>\n<p>Each&nbsp;<em>Ugly</em> Trait the animal has,&nbsp;halves the listed price and improves @JournalEntry[Going To Market]{Availability} by one step.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note: Exotic items do not have their Availability modified by being Flawed &mdash; they are always difficult to find, even shoddy examples.</p>"}

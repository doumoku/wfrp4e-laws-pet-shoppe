The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Tiny","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"l58D88EANPIjVyth","name":"Skittish","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is easily scared by magic or loud noises.

You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture alone. Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’. However, if you fail any of these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or cause Fear) in affected opponents. With your GM’s permission you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you having seen through your bravado once already.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Alternative Characteristics For Intimidate</h3>\n<p>While strength is the default stat for Intimidate tests, the GM may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different characteristic: a steely witch hunter may use Willpower to stare down an inquisitive bystander, or an academic may use Intelligence to cow a lowly student with his intimidating knowledge, for instance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Example: </span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4 SL on her Intimidate Test.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Tiny","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":3200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"mQxCOwdUjpvbCMHI","name":"Swim","type":"skill","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/adv-skill-s.png","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Your ability to swim in water without drowning.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Small","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":700000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"2gMyZdV0IB77T4BY","name":"Swarm","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Swarms are large numbers of the same creature acting as one.

So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suﬀer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Small","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":800000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"HA6CV1ioh4XZqbqY","name":"Stride","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>The creature has a long stride, perhaps because it is a quadruped or has especially long legs.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Little","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"NRdQ5uH726B12uhc","name":"Stealthy","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is especially stealthy.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Tiny","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":3200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"IUWfVOmEKdtoREx1","name":"Cold Blooded","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is cold-blooded and slow to react.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suﬀer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Small","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":800000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"q1eOWrT9VV6XIWlv","name":"Stride","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>The creature has a long stride, perhaps because it is a quadruped or has especially long legs.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Tiny","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":3200000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"mQxCOwdUjpvbCMHI","name":"Swim","type":"skill","img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/skills/adv-skill-s.png","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>Your ability to swim in water without drowning.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Enormous","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":1300001,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"buTmPCFzkR37rZ7y","name":"Skittish","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is easily scared by magic or loud noises.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Little","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"details"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"zwIpXXXBWsgZTY0F","name":"Stealthy","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"The creature is especially stealthy.

So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Little","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":3300000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description","core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.wfrp4e-core.traits.8slW8CJ2oVTxeQ6q"}},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"1Lkut7UUTdsgX9bE","name":"Night Vision","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>You can see very well in natural darkness.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\" title=\"\" border=\"1\" summary=\"\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Size </span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wounds</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Tiny</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">1</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Little</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Toughness Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Small</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Average</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9312in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8472in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Large</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 4.0in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Enormous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: .8666in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">Monstrous</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: top; width: 3.9812in; padding: 4pt 4pt 4pt 4pt; border: 1pt solid #A3A3A3;\">\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">(Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"gmdescription":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":""},"rollable":{"value":false,"damage":false,"skill":"","label":"Rollable","type":"Boolean","rollCharacteristic":"","bonusCharacteristic":"","dice":"","defaultDifficulty":"challenging","SL":true,"attackType":"melee"},"specification":{"value":"Small","type":"String","label":"Specification"},"source":{"type":"String","label":"Source"}},"sort":800000,"flags":{"_sheetTab":"description"},"img":"modules/wfrp4e-core/icons/traits/trait.png","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"HA6CV1ioh4XZqbqY","name":"Stride","type":"trait","data":{"description":{"type":"String","label":"Description","value":"<p>The creature has a long stride, perhaps because it is a quadruped or has especially long legs.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suﬀer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step diﬀerence. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way.

It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically. If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal. All other results mean the larger creature wins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stomp</h3>\n<p>Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way. This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0, and uses Melee(Brawling).</p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0in; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: #231f20;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"direction: ltr;\">\n<table style=\"direction: ltr;

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Size Combat Modifers</h3>\n<p>If larger:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger.</li>\n<li>It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied.</li>\n<li>All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the Deathblow rule, even if the target survives.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If smaller:</p>\n<p>• It gains a bonus of +10 to hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Defending Against Big Creatures</h3>\n<p>You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test. It is recommended to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Fear and Terror</h3>\n<p>If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more steps smaller. The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step difference. So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small, it will cause Terror 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Moving in Combat</h3>\n<p>A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out of the way, moving where it wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Opposed Strength</h3>\n<p>During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is 2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically.

If one creature is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to contest the roll. If it does, SL are compared as normal.
